# Day 2
Though I had a shorter day, today definetely felt longer! I had our first full morning session and my class moves right along. We shifted from XPath into Xquery, which meant taking a step back from writing in oXygen. Though the content was trickier, I found myself understanding XPath better and how to properly organize my thoughts in a way that made sense in the programming language. I also learned that I am the only undergraduate in my class - go me! The rest of the students are professors, PhD students, or professionals who use digital humanities in my field. Though my knowledge is shorter in comparison, I am still learning at a fast pace that makes class busy!
