# Day 4

Day 4 was mostly surrounded back in oXygen working with Schematron and piecing together everything. I was a big fan of Schematron, once I got it to work I was having fun! Schematron can be used to check XML files for errors en masse. That way instead of searching people are able to encode messages that will give errors when mistakes are made by humans in the code. We tested this out by using the three stooges. I coded myself as a fourth stooge and was able to make myself show errors when I told it to look for three stooges when I had made myself four. 

## Content Creation

I was also asked to make DHSI content for the Loyola Maryland instagram today! I've been taking a lot of pictures, so it will be easier for me to see
