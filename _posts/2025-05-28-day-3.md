# Day 3
Well, today was exciting!! I felt like I finally understood what my teachers were talking about. We had finished our Xquery yesterday and it definetely hurt my head. However, putting it all together with XHTML and writing in XML again was familiar and exciting. I was happy to understand how Xquery could create things, and I was even able to format a poem online! It's not available online, but my preview shows that I was able to create something taht could be published and preserved online, which I think is neat! We also made a table using one of the teachers' pre-existing data from a project. It's cool to see how they thought of how things can come together using coding langauges for the humanities!
