# Day 1
Today I had my first session of my XML class! It was kind of a lot, to be honest. The syllabus, though extensive, was helpful; my professors went step by step in their instructions. In the morning we did eXist-db, exploring what basic XPath expressions looked like. By the afternoon we had shifted to oXygen editor, a software system capable of coding in multiple languages. The course will cover a few like Schematron and XQuery, but we were focused on XPath for the day. With our copy of Hamlet, we were instructed on how to make search expressions that filtered what were looking for. It was difficult at first to nail how it should be done, but it got a little easier throughout the day. Ideally tomorrow I get more comfortable with the experience!
