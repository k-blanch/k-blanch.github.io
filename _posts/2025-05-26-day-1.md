# Day 1
Today I had my first session of my XML class! It was kind of a lot, to be honest. The syllabus, though extensive, was helpful; my professors went step by step in their instructions. In the morning we did eXist-db, exploring what basic XPath expressions looked like. It was pretty easy to go step-by-step as we took it small with counting expressions. One of my favorites was upper-case(translate('Hi, Mom!','aeiou', 'xxxxx')), which turned the vowels in "Hi, Mom!" into the letter x. Though small, it was really neat to see how I could transform things! 
By the afternoon we had shifted to oXygen editor, a software system capable of coding in multiple languages. The course will cover a few like Schematron and XQuery, but we were focused on XPath for the day. With our copy of Hamlet, we were instructed on how to make search expressions that filtered what were looking for. One of the more important things we learned was making sure we searched properly in the TEI database by using "/TEI/text/body/div", which is the document node. It's like a header in some ways, with divisions (absolute paths) that indicates where you want to do. It was difficult at first to nail how it should be done, but it got a little easier throughout the day. Ideally tomorrow I get more comfortable with the experience!
