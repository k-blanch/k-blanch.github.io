# Test

This my intro post for DHSI. My goal for DHSI is to learn more about the digital humanities in a collaborative setting. As a History major and aspiring archivist, it's cool to see how information and documents can be stored online for public access. I'm excited to go to Montreal!  
A webiste I use often is **[Google](https://www.google.com/)**. 
I like dogs like the one below.

Thanks for reading my test post!

## Introduction

I started making this blog because I was told it would be more of a challenge to operate. The interface I am coding with is different than other user-friendly websites, but so far I haven't felt over my head. I've gotten comfortable enough with GitHub to help others out, but at the same time, I don't have all the answers. However, I think my XML class will be useful in helping me figure out answers! It's a class that Dr. Witt said would build on what I already know thanks to working with him, but I still felt in over my head when I opened the syllabus. So many things to download, a lot of sites that need passwords and downloads. I had to get Slack for the first time, which made me feel way more grown up than my 20 years. Though the interface was similar to what I've known before, I was still swimming with new vocabulary after the first and second pass of the syllabus. 
At the end of the day, I'm looking forward to learning oXygen and Xpath to help others out. Also, getting a better night's sleep - last night I didn't sleep too well. Here's to a week in Canada!
